# coding-task
<h4>Intro</h4></br>
Coding-task is the proposed solution for the management of those users who have the same identifier as the administrator logging in.
<h4>Installing and updating</h4></br>
Just as simple as follows: 'npm install -g json-server' and 'npm install' for installing the dependencies.
Then, run 'npm run backend' to start the mocked backend server and 'npm start' to launch the application.
<h4>How to use</h4></br>
The application is simple: once you have logged in with your Google account, all existing users will be displayed on the screen. You can access the details of all of them, but there is an editing/deletion restriction on those users who have been registered by the logged-in administrator.
<h4>Used technology</h4></br>
A mocked backend has been used to simulate requests to a real backend to allow adding, editing, querying or deleting users.
